**Statistics about the <u>CVE-2020-8512</u>**

Today, we all know that Icewarp has more than 50 million users around the world. According to the analysis I scanned and filtered with a few search engines such as Shodan(Censys, Zoomeye etc.) and Shodan, approximately 35-thousand servers are currently using the Icewarp service. Of course, if we try to add servers that we cannot reach in search engines, I am sure that this number will double.
