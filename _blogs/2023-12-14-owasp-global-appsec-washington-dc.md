### Introduction:
Greetings to my professional colleagues and readers. This blog post delves into my enriching experience at the OWASP Global AppSec Washington D.C. 2023, where I had the honor of contributing as a speaker. This international cybersecurity conference, held in October 2023, was not only a platform for professional exchange but also a significant milestone in my career journey. Here, I share detailed insights into the conference, my presentation, and the invaluable experiences I gathered.

### Conference Overview:
The OWASP Global AppSec conference was a convergence of pioneering ideas and cutting-edge practices in cybersecurity. The event brought together a diverse group of professionals, including industry leaders, researchers, and practitioners. The exchange of ideas and collaborative discussions over these few weeks provided a unique learning opportunity and a chance to understand the latest trends and challenges facing the cybersecurity world.

My presentation on October 30 was a defining moment. I showcased my project, the OWASP Top 25 Parameters, which I began developing in my mid-teens and eventually transferred to OWASP in 2023, thereby stepping into the role of an OWASP Project Leader. The presentation covered the intricate details of the project, its evolution over the years, and its impact on the field. The project’s focus on the most frequently detected parameters in security vulnerabilities offers a comprehensive look at current cybersecurity challenges.
