In June of this year, I found a CORS Misconfiguration vulnerability in a datacenter company. The system was very simple, a PUT command sent to the API Server
both changed the account email and showed all the data of the account in JSON format as Response. Then, I reported this weakness and the company rewarded me 
with a $$$ bounty. Also, I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/bugraeskici">Bugra Eskici</a> , who helped me a lot to detect this vulnerability.

### Recon
I was reviewing the responses by sending requests to the system. When I looked at request header, I saw that the "Origin" attribute was defined.
The vulnerable site was defined in the "Origin" attribute as a value, and this value was also defined in the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" attribute in the Response.
Also, the "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" value was "true".

### Is it vulnerable?
I write evil.com as the value to Origin. And Bingo! The response status was "200 OK" and evil.com was also included in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin attribute.<br>

That is, there was a CORS Misconfiguration vulnerability.

### Double Shot!!
I can change the account email with a simple PUT request. Moreover, the server was showing the sensitive data of the account as Response. Then, I have created a simple
script for both changing email and stealing sensitive data.

You can find the script I created in my tweet:

With the script, I changed the e-mail address by sending a PUT request. (Account Takeover)

Then, I sent the Response containing sensitive data to a request-bin service with this script.

And, sensitive data sent the attacker's site.

So I was able to both change the e-mail address of the victim account and steal sensitive data. Both vulnerabilities were caused by CORS Misconfiguration.
As I have explained, it is possible to exploit these vulnerabilities with a simple script.

### The end :

10 June 2020 - Report sent<br>
10 June 2020 - Confirmed <br>
11 June 2020 - I awarded a $$$ bounty<br>
